Product Manager- TerraStream,CA$54k-CA$144k (Glassdoor Est.),"ABOUT SKYWATCH

Every day, hundreds of trillions of pixels of our planet are captured from space. With new applications for this data emerging, such as precision farming, construction planning, disaster relief operations, and retail revenue prediction (to name a few), the demand for satellite imagery is growing. However, the current process for obtaining satellite imagery is very time-consuming and tedious.

SkyWatch is a venture-backed space technology company in Waterloo focused on the seamless and affordable distribution of satellite data to commercial markets, enabling businesses, applications, and solutions that were never before possible.

OUR TEAM

Let’s face it, the best jobs boil down to a handful of things — getting the chance to work with amazing people in a great culture with a leader who has your back, while pursuing a vision that you can get passionate about.

Our team consists of NASA award-winning developers, Earth observation scientists, big data and unicorn startup veterans who come from ten different countries. Our leadership team includes leading figures in Canadian space, an Earth Observation veteran who has led multiple companies through IPOs, a planetary robotics graduate from the International Space University, and a petabyte-scale data leader with patents in location AI and contextual analytics.

We’re a well-financed company, backed by some of the best early-stage investors in our industry, our country, and in the Bay Area. We have a unique blend of space, satellite, enterprise, and consumer application veterans. And we are just getting started.

OUR PRODUCTS

Today, satellite imagery is expensive and difficult for customers to access and manage. SkyWatch addresses these challenges through two products: 1) EarthCache, an easy-to-use Application Programming Interface (“API”), allowing application developers to programmatically integrate satellite imagery, from multiple imagery providers, into their software; and 2) TerraStream, a data infrastructure product that provides satellite operators with an integrated data storage, cataloging, ordering, processing and delivery solution, allowing them to serve customers faster, with less operational and financial risk.

Our technology is enabling agriculture customers to monitor crop health; energy customers to monitor oil pipelines and solar farms; and global banks to monitor infrastructure development, among hundreds of other unique use cases. All from space, with just a few lines of code.

OUR CULTURE

Culture is the personality of a company. It is our company's shared beliefs, values, and practices. At SkyWatch, our culture is incredibly important to us, and we practice it every day. Both as a company and in our products we value simplicity, dependability, and empathy.

THE ROLE

SkyWatch is seeking a Product Manager for TerraStream, a data infrastructure product that provides satellite operators with an integrated data storage, cataloging, ordering, processing and delivery solution, allowing them to serve customers faster, with less operational and financial risk.
